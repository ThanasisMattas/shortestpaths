  """Evaluates the probability an edge exists, by the "proximity" of its nodes.

  Utilizing the numeric naming of the nodes, the distance between two nodes is
  taken as the absolute of the difference of their ids. For example, nodes 1
  and 5 will have distance 4.

  This probability will be used to build a modified Gilbert version of the
  Erdős-Rényi model, where instead of one coherent probability, each edge wiil
  have its own probability of existence.

  This function regulates the form and the density of the graph. By forcing a
  more sparse graph, we will get shortest-paths with more hops. thus aiding the
  visualization and the analysis. For that reason, distant edges are penalized,
  by getting low probability and big weights.

  The basis of the probability distribution is the sigmoid function, which out-
  puts values in the desired range 0-1, and provides simple parametric control.
  More specifically, working as a high-pass filter, cuts out the edge distances
  after its center.

  Control over the form and the density of the graph can be used in different
  kinds of analyses.

  The graph model parameters are:

    * center (c):
      controls the form and the density of the graph; values: (1, n-1)
        close to 0: filters out distant edges; graph becomes more sparse
        close to n: incorporates more distant edges; graph becomes more dense
    * gradient (λ):
      controls the form of the graph; values: (0, 1]
        close to 1: steep cut of probabilities after the center
        close to 0: smoother diffusion of the probability distribution near the
                    center
    * initial_probability (p_0):
      controls the density of the graph; values: (0, 1]
        p_0 (up) (up) density

  Note that the sigmoid distribution is inverted, by subtracting it from 1, to
  shift the lower probability to distant edges.

  (see _edge_probability() docstring)

  The graph is represented by its adjacency list. NetworkX is used only for
  plotting.

  NOTE:
    When nodes are weighted:
    1. The weight that each neighbor holds at the adjacency list (the edge we-
       ight) is increased by by its node-weight. Whereas this holds true for
       the adjacency list, it is not correct when adding the weighted edges to
       the nx.Graph object, but that's ok, because the nx.Graph object is used
       only for plotting.
    2. The undirected graph is converted to a digraph, since each undirected
       edge breaks into two edges with opposite directions and different
       weights. For each hop, we pay the weight of the edge plus the weight of
       the head. Namely,

                 {a, b}, weight_a, weight_b, weight_edge
                                becomes

                     (b, a), weight_edge + weight_a

       This way each edge is related to one value, instead of three, therefore
       Dijkstra's algorithm can operate without modifications.
    3. In case of a digraph, the edge_weight is increased by the head weight.
